Contents of charge. —(1) Every charge under this Code shall state the offence with which the \\naccused is charged. \\n (2) If the law which creates the offence gives it any specific name, the offence may be described in \\nthe charge by that name only. \\n(3) If the law which creates the offence does not give it any specific name, so much of the definition \\nof the offence must be stated as to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged. \\n(4) The law and section of the law against which the offence is said to have been committed shall be \\nmentioned in the charge. \\n(5) The fact that the charge is made is equivalent to a statement that every legal condition required by \\nlaw to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case. \\n(6) The charge shall be written in the language of the Court. \\n(7) If the accused, having been previously convicted of any offence, is liable, by reason of such \\nprevious conviction, to enhanced punishment, or to punishment of a di fferent kind, for a subsequent \\noffence, and it is intended to prove such previous conviction for the purpose of affecting the punishment \\nwhich the Court may think fit to award for the subsequent offence, the fact, date and place of the previous \\nconviction shall be stated in the charge; and if such statement has been omitted, the Court may add it at \\nany time before sentence is passed. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A is charged with the murder of B. This is equivalent to a statement that A's act fell within the definitio n of murder \\ngiven in sections 299 and 300 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860); that it did not fall within any of the general exception s \\nof the said Code; and that it did not fall within any of the five exceptions to section 300, or that, if it did fall within \\nException 1, one or other of the three provisos to that exception applied to it. \\n(b) A is charged under section 326 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to B \\nby means of an instrument for shooting. This is eq uivalent to a statement that the case was not provided for by section 335 \\nof the said Code, and that the general exceptions did not apply to it. \\n(c) A is accused of murder, cheating, theft, extortion, adultery or criminal intimidation, or using a false pro perty-mark. \\nThe charge may state that A committed murder, or cheating, or theft, or extortion, or adultery, or criminal intimidation, or \\nthat he used a false property -mark, without reference to the definition s, of those crimes contained in the Indian Penal  Code \\n(45 of 1860); but the sections under which the offence is punishable must, in each instance be referred to in the charge. \\n(d) A is charged under section 184 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) with intentionally obstructing a sale of \\nproperty offered for sale by the lawful authority of a public servant. The charge should be in those words. \\n212.

Effect of errors.— No error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated \\nin the charge, and no omission to state the offence or those particulars,  shall be regarded at any  stage of \\nthe case as material, unless the accused was in fact misled by such error or omission, and it has \\noccasioned a failure of justice. \\nIllustrations \\n(a) A is charged under section 242 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), w ith “having been in possession of \\ncounterfeit coin, having known at the time when he became possessed thereof that  such coin was counterfeit ,” the word \\n“fraudulently” being omitted in the charge. Unless it appears that A was in fact misled by this omission , the error shall not \\nbe regarded as material. \\n(b) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge or is set out \\nincorrectly. A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction.

In fact, the murdered person's name was \\nHaidar Baksh, and the date of the murder was the 20th January, 1882.

The Court may infer \\nfrom these facts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immaterial. \\n(e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 1882, and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest hi m \\nfor that murder) on the 21st January, 1882. When charged for the murder of Haidar Baksh, he was tried for the murder of \\nKhoda Baksh. The witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh.
